I'm a Research Fellow at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS), working with Prof. [Tulika Mitra](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tulika/). My research focuses on AI system acceleration and architectural optimization, aiming to achieve low-cost, energy-efficient, and high-performance AI computing through software–hardware co-design.

I build specialized systems for emerging AI workloads, including heterogeneous near-memory computing and architectures for large language model (LLM) acceleration. Recent work explores near-memory acceleration for RAG/LLM pipelines, sparse matrix operators, and graph workloads, with an emphasis on practical energy-efficiency and scalable performance.

Prior to that, I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://english.hust.edu.cn/) (2018–2024) under Prof. [Hai Jin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o02W0aEAAAAJ&hl=en), and a B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology from [North China Electric Power University](https://english.ncepu.edu.cn/) (2014–2018).

My research interests sit at the intersection of software–hardware co-design, near-memory computing, and AI acceleration, and currently include (i) heterogeneous near-memory systems for LLM and retrieval-augmented generation, (ii) specialized architectures for sparse operators and attention, and (iii) energy-efficient graph computing platforms. My work appears in venues such as ISCA, SC, DAC, IPDPS, and TC/TCAD, and has been recognized by honors including chip100 and the China International “Internet+” Innovation & Entrepreneurship Competition Gold Award.
